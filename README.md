# Certify Certificate Generator

Welcome to the Certify Certificate Generator, an open-source project built using the Django web framework. This application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, allowing users to create customized certificates. It provides functionality to generate certificates in bulk and send them via email. This README file provides an overview of the project, detailed installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other relevant information.

## Features

1.  **Customizable Certificate Creation**: The application allows users to create customized certificates using templates and customizable fields such as participant name, event title, date, and more. Users can select from various fonts, colors, and designs to match their preferences. The application also supports uploading custom certificate templates.

2.  **Bulk Certificate Generation**: Users can generate multiple certificates in bulk by uploading a CSV file containing participant data. The application automatically populates the certificate templates with the corresponding participant information, saving time and effort. The CSV file should have headers that match the template fields.

3.  **Email Integration**: The application includes email integration, enabling users to send generated certificates directly to participants via email. Users can customize the email template and include personalized messages or additional attachments. The email settings can be configured in the Django settings file.

4.  **User Management**: The application provides user management features, allowing administrators to create and manage user accounts. User roles and permissions can be assigned to control access to the certificate generation and bulk email functionality. The admin panel can be accessed at `/admin`.

5.  **Template Library**: Users can create and manage a library of certificate templates for easy access and reuse. Templates can be categorized, edited, and deleted as needed. The application supports uploading custom templates in HTML format.

6.  **Customization Options**: The application offers a range of customization options, including fonts, colors, alignment, and size, to create visually appealing and professional-looking certificates. These options can be configured in the template editor.

    Create a superuser account to access the admin panel.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your superuser account.

7.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

8.  **Access the application**:
    Open a web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:8000`. You can log in to the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin` using the superuser credentials you created.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can register an account or log in with their existing credentials. After authentication, users can create customized certificates by selecting a template, filling in the required fields, and applying desired styles.

For bulk certificate generation, users can upload a CSV file containing participant data and select a template to automatically generate certificates for all participants. The application provides options to review and modify the generated certificates before finalizing the process. The CSV file should have headers that match the template fields.

Users can also utilize the email integration feature to send the generated certificates directly to participants via email. Customization options for the email template and attachments are available in the admin panel.
